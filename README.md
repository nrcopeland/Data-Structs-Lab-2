TEXT AND OTHER MATERIALS
Textbook:
 Data Structures & Algorithm Analysis (Third Edition), Mark Allen Weiss, ISBN13: 978-0132576277
 Other data structure textbooks cover the required topics might be used. However,
the students must aware that the implementation, illustration or emphasis of different
textbook may be different.
Resources: Course assignments and materials are on e-learning (D2L) site
Software: Any IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for JAVA programming
development (Eclipse will be used in class if there is a need for programming
demonstration)
COURSE DESCRIPTION
1. An introductory course to Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis
2. Topics include fundamental data structures (array-based, linked list – based), Linear
ADT and their implementations (Queue & Stacks), non-Linear ADT and their
implementations (Tree, Hashing, Priority Queue and Graphs), and introduction to
design and complexity analysis for algorithms
3. 3 semester hours
4. Prerequisite: CSCI 1302 and MATH 2510 with a grade of C or higher
METHODS OF INSTRUCTION
Lecture, discussion, demonstration and development of programming on related topics
EVALUATION METHODS
Assignments, lab projects and exams. 
COURSE OBJECTIVES
On completion of the course, students should have a clear idea of data structures, abstract
data types, algorithm design and analysis as a designer or programmer. You will study
algorithms that let you manipulate data types. Finally, we will analyze these algorithms,
and try to categorize them with regard to their performance (time complexity).

POLICIES AND EXPECTATIONS
 Missed Work
There are NO make-up exams without proper documentation of a legitimate
extenuating circumstance. With proper documentation of a legitimate extenuating
circumstance in advance, you may arrange to take the final exam BEFORE it is
administered to the rest of the class. The re-scheduled exams are recommended to
be taken in the test center. Please check the requirement of the test center before
head if there is a need. If such arrangements are not made, you will receive a zero
on any missed exam. All exam will be taken in the classroom during the class
time only.
 Late Submission
Assignments turned in late will be penalized 10% per calendar day; No late
submission will be accepted after three days. For example, if an assignment is due
on Jan. 23rd, no late submission will be accepted after Jan. 26th. All missed
submission will receive a grade of zero. There may be a rare exception to this rule if
you can document legitimate unforeseen extenuating circumstances. In these cases,
you must request an extension before the submission deadline. All extensions should
be requested by e-mail and are granted solely at the instructor’s discretion. Please
note that if you have to miss a class, you do so at your own risk; extensions or
exceptions will not be granted simply because you were not present when the
material was covered in class.
 Disagreement on Grading
If you have any disagreement or concern on a grade that you receive in this class,
you have 7 days to contact me after the grade is released on D2L.
 Attendance
Attendance is strongly recommended; it is essential to complete all assignments and
keep up with topics as they are covered. You are responsible for all material
presented, all announcements made, and all assignments given in every class,
whether or not you are present. Keeping up with these items is your responsibility.
(There are contents that covered in this class not from the textbook.)
 No-meet in Class Event
Due to inclement weather or special arrangement, we may not meet in class. Online
lecture or other study tasks will be uploaded to D2L. Please make sure you follow
the instruction of the instructor to finish the study tasks. There will be no class
cancelation without study instruction is provided. 
REMARKS
1. This syllabus represents a general plan and it is subject to change if deemed
necessary by the instructor. Due date may be changed according to the process of
class. All changes will be declared in class and updated on D2L accordingly. It is
the student’s responsibility to check all those updates.
2. The students are expected to spend 3- 6 hours every week. More hours on course
assignments are expected if you did not have strong Java Programming skills.
3. All assignments will be posted at least a week prior to its due date, please make sure
you check D2L in a timely manner and start to work on it early. This time is given
is because several students may need that much time to finish the assignment. All
assignments are due before the class starts on the due date.
4. Please refer to Student Handbook for more details. “a grade of W may be
assigned when students fail to attend 10% of any class meetings prior to the
midpoint of the term; a grade of WF will be assigned when students stop
attending after the midpoint”.
5. Tardiness and/or early departures: Students are expected not to disrupt class when
arriving or leaving. Arriving late is disruptive to the instructor and to your fellow
students. Please be on time. If a late arrival or early departure is unavoidable, please
be as discreet and inconspicuous as possible (i.e., INVISIBLE).
6. There is no extra credits or projects available at the end of semester. Emails or
conversation regarding “is there anything you can do to get a better grade” will
simply be ignored at the end of the semester or after the due date of an assignment.
No emails will be replied after the final exam except you want to check your final
exam. So make sure you work hard and work closely with me during the semester if
you want to a good grade. Spent as much effort as you need to get the grade you
want. The final letter grade will be assigned strictly based on the grading rule.
